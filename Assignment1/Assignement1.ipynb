    "We went further and modelled weekly volatility. The method we chose is to calculate the standard deviation of the log-returns for the last five days. Hence, we observe greater consistency in volatility, as the effect of greater deviation persists for at least 5 days. Still, however, what is interesting is the limited effect of great volatility on the future volatility. This might be caused by the low liquidity of the market, as the significant deviations are driven by a few traders who sell or buy in large quantities. As the trade magnitude then decreases, the volatility of log-returns also diminishes. "
